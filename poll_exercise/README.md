# Poll Exercise

## Description

You just learned how to make long lived processes that can maintain state. This
exercise will give you a chance to practice what you've learned.

## Challenge

In this exercise you'll create several functions in the Poll module
(`lib\poll.ex`) to satisfy the tests found in `test\poll_test.exs`.

NOTE: there's a good chance you'll struggle on this challenge.  Do you're best
to complete the challenge on your own, but if you get stuck you can take a look
at my solution as described below.

### Running Tests

You can run the tests with the following command: `$ mix test`

### Solution

When you're done, you can look at my solution in the `poll_exercise_completed`
directory.
The github repository has the solution it's
